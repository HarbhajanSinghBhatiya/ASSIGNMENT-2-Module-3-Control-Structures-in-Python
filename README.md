1.Python Program: Check Even or Odd

This repository contains a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

Program Description

The program prompts the user to input an integer. It then uses an `if-else` statement to check whether the number is even or odd:

- If the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0), the program prints that the number is even.
- Otherwise, the program prints that the number is odd.

Output

Enter a number: 7
The number 7 is odd.

Enter a number: 8
The number 8 is even.

2.Python Program: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This repository contains a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers within this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

Program Description

- The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 50 and adds them up. After all the numbers are summed, it displays the final result, which is the sum of integers from 1 to 50.

Output

The sum of all integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
